# Detent handoff notes

- Issue #9 adds the initial React/TypeScript frontend shell under `frontend/src`.
- Entry point: `frontend/src/main.tsx`; router and layout: `frontend/src/App.tsx`; global styling: `frontend/src/index.css`.
- Vite entry document is `frontend/index.html`; `BrowserRouter` serves `/` plus placeholder routes for `/classes`, `/assignments`, `/students`, and `/settings`.
- Validation: `cd frontend && npm run build`, `npm run lint`, and repository gate `true`.
- GitHub CLI is unauthenticated in this worker (`gh auth status` reports missing credentials), so issue Workpad/PR operations require a later authenticated handoff.
